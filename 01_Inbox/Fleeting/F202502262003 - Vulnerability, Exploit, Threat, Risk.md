# Fleeting: {{Defining Terms for Security}}

## Thought
A vulnerability:
- flaw or weakness capable of being exploited
	- analogy to a tear in a shirt, you put your finger in and it gets wider and wider
- how is it done on a computer?: misconfiguration, code flaws, weak passwords, default credentials
	- MITRE -- Common Weakness enumeration: list of weakness types, not CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) specific flaws in software

An exploit:
- code that takes advantage of a vulnerability. 
	- memory management that gains remote access to the system

A threat:
- threat actor that intends on causing harm
	- wide variety: "analogy of a villain"
		- user who accidentally clicks the wrong button, worm

A risk: 
- potential for damage or loss
- calculation: (Probability of occurence) * (Potential impact)
- likelihood: measured by a security team expert. 
	- pen testers: estimate risk of vulnerabilities we find
		- remove risk? patch vulnerability

## Context
Part of the classification of the red team definitions that we as penetration testers work on.
